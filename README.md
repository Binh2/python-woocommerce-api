## Demo

Really sorry for the quality, because GitHub only allow 10MB per video file.

## Setup
You will have to WooCommerce API first and generate secret keys. I put an example ini.json at the root of the project (because I only build for localhost)

Change the ini.json to your specific Wordpress website. 

```bash
pip install WooCommerce
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-WTF
```

`python run.py` to run Flask server
